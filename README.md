# FieldedSDM
Fielded Sequential Dependence Model (paper, runs, code).

All experiments was performed using [Galago](http://sourceforge.net/p/lemur/galago/ci/default/tree/).
Models are implemented as Galago traversals. You can find them in `galago/` directory.
Please see [documentation](http://sourceforge.net/p/lemur/wiki/Galago%20Traversals/#implementing-your-own-traversal)
to understand how to configure Galago to use them.
